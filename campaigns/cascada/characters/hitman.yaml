effects:
  - Inelegant:
    description: >
      You have a certain lovable charm. You are trained in all pleasant social interactions when you express a lighthearted, 
      self-deprecating manner.
  - Dumb Luck:
    description: >
      The GM can introduce a GM intrusion on you, based on your clumsiness, without awarding you any XP (as if you had rolled
      a 1 on a d20 roll). However, if this happens, 50% of the time, your clumsiness works to your advantage. Rather than 
      hurting you (much), it helps you, or it hurts your enemies. You slip, but it’s just in time to duck an attack. You 
      fall down, but you trip your enemies as you crash into their legs. You turn around too quickly, but you end up 
      knocking the weapon from your foe’s hand.
  - Did I Do That: 
    description: >
      You’ve got a certain bull-like quality. You are trained in tasks involving breaking things.
  - No Coordination:
    description: >
      Any task that involves balance, grace, or hand-to-eye coordination is hindered.
cyphers:
  - Rebreather:
    description:
      An ISA rebreathing device, a single use mouth piece for breathing underwater, and in environments without available
      raw oxygen. Usually lasts 10 minutes with normal usage. If the user over exerts themselves, depletes faster.
  - Light-slice Crystal:
    description:
      Adepts can manipulate light-slice crystals to make themselves temporarily invisible (but still corporeal). Works by
      slicing the light and bending it round its wearer. Once used, the crystal is damaged and cannot be reused. Effective
      for 30 seconds. 
  - Adept Lightning Capacitors:
    description:
      Single use gauntlets, with pre-charged capacitors capable of delivering a targeted electrical shock across a short range
      with a damage of 6. Due to the ability of adepts to visualise targets, this weapon can cast around corners, and through
      any material that will not disrupt the path of an electrical current (i.e. water)
clothing:
  - Pantsuit
  - Hooded long coat
  - Sneakers
weapons:
  - ISA Light service pistol
equipment:
  - Psychic Lock Pick:
    description: >
      Lock picking tools typically have handles and various other things, that are necessary for users that don't
      have the ability to manipulate small physical objects with their mind. Your lock picking tools have had the handles
      removed and special metals laced into them to make picking locks with your mind easier. Eases lock-picking tasks 
      by one level
  - Telekinetic Bolas:
    description: >
      balls on a rope are a primitive way to trip up and disturb the balance of targets, but effective when you can target
      them accurately with your mind. Eases escaping tasks and chase tasks.

description: >
  A man in a hologram hurriedly warns you about an impending attack, as your computer screen flickers with a host of files
  you're receiving, suddenly the man turns. Banging can be heard on the audio, and then a hail of gun shots as the man leaves
  the frame of the hologram and the transmission cuts out. You feel an intense and overwhelming sadness, as you cry. You slam
  the desk with your fists, before recomposing yourself. But he means nothing to you now, who is he? Why were you so sad?
  and what was he warning you about?
  As a young Telepath from a privileged background, you joined the Internal Security Agency, ISA, of The Quorum of Twelve, when
  you were 19. Telepaths are generally feared throughout the habited worlds, and occurences of telepathic abilities have
  dropped significantly due to the stigmatisation surrounding them. Yet telepathic abilities are a great asset for people in
  certain roles.
  Trained to use your telepathic abilities in the field, you are a well respected agent, even in spite of the well known
  clumsiness and chaos that follows you wherever you go.
