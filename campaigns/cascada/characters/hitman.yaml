  The smoke of a burning Uspid Pot fills the hotel room, the local narcotic 
  delicacy is not to your taste, but your half naked companion likes it and 
  so that's good enough. The receiver on the table side buzzes once, and 
  you answer. Instructions to intercept an ISA security team and recover 
  a data payload from them, The rest is a blur, but now you're on their 
  ship, and neither you nor they are dead, so circumstances have clearly 
  changed. What happened in the 24 hours since then, is less clear.

  You are an Orrin Corporation clone. The Orrin Corporation uses clones 
  to genetically enhance them for specific tasks that unenhanced humans 
  can't do. It is illegal to clone on most worlds, but clones are protected 
  under Quorum charter, so once created, it is illegal to destroy them just 
  for existing.

  You were one of three, cloned for the purpose of private corporate 
  espionage, assassination and if necessary special operations in private 
  corporate wars.

      The onslaught of fighters firing upon The Citrine Eagle was overwhelming, as you attempted to return fire, you could barely 
      distinguish one target from another as a dozen fighters swarmed the eagle. Even with The Captain's flying the ship wouldn't 
      have held much longer, but then suddenly the fighters begin exploding as you feel yourself lose consciousness
