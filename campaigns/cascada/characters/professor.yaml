skills:
  - Fits of Insight:
    description: >
      Whenever such knowledge is appropriate, the GM feeds you information although there is no clear explanation as to how
      you could know such a thing. This is up to the GM’s discretion 
  - Erratic Behavior: 
    description: >
      You are prone to acting erratically or irrationally. When you are in the presence of a major discovery or subjected to
      great stress (such as a serious physical threat), the GM can introduce a GM intrusion that directs your next action 
      without awarding XP. You can still pay 1 XP to refuse the intrusion. The GM’s influence is the manifestation of 
      your madness and thus is always something you would not likely do otherwise, but it is not directly, obviously harmful 
      to you unless there are extenuating circumstances. (For example, if a foe suddenly leaps out of the darkness, you might 
      spend the first round babbling incoherently or screaming the name of your first true love.)
  - Advanced AI Research:
    description: >
      Everyone knows that the Werr-Heyn Proof shows that AI can never achieve a level of sentience equal to that of living
      mammals... Except you. You've dedicated your life to researching Advanced AI technologies which others consider mad
      All interactions with intelligent systems (AI computers/robots etc) is eased by 1
  - resisting mental attacks:
    level: -1
    description: >
      Resisting mental attacks is hindered
cyphers:
  - Warping Nanovirus:
    description:
      No mad scientist would be fit without a couple of doomsday devices lying around, and at least one on their person
      at all times. The warping nanovirus came to you in a dream, and you forgot it in another dream, but alas you still
      have a vial of the prototype, loaded into an autotargetting serum injector. It deals 6 damage, plus 2 damage for 3 
      rounds as it convulses its victims organs. Victim must be in immediate range.
  - Charged finger:
    description:
      The worst part about tasers is their ease to spot, so why not replace your finger for one and then amp it up to 50,000
      Volts and use it on unsuspecting victims. Your right index finger is a prosthetic taser, with a single charge use
      that when used on an unsuspecting target immediately incapacitates them. Cannot be used during combat
clothing:
  - Shirt
  - Surfer shorts
  - Sandals
  - Hooded vest
weapons:
equipment:
  - Technology scanner:
    description: >
      How can you steal other people's ideas without understanding them first? The technology scanner eases the perception
      of any tech related items.
  - Translator:
    description: >
      A small device you built whilst arguing with a colleague at the Scientific Institute, the translator learns any language
      and translates to and from it. Unfortunately it has a tendency to back fire and express a rude sentiment. Generally
      eases social interaction tasks across languages. May result in a GM Intrusion.
  - Datajacker:
    description: >
      You have a small port concealed by your jawline, mistakeable for a piercing, into which you can interface with most 
      computer and security terminals. You are removed from reality for the duration of a datajack, and so cannot perceive
      things going on around you. Typical data jacks take 5 mins. Eases any technology task
  - The Book:
    description: >
      Much to the mockery of your colleagues, you still carry around a paper book into which you scribble notes or insights
      that you have. As a result, you may gain additional insight during exploration of new environments
character references:
  - Professor Farnsworth
  - Doc Brown
  - Pretty much any tech guy from any sci fi series ever
description: >
  Whispers and stares in the hallway as Internal Security Agency officials carry boxes out of you office at the Scientific
  Institute. They can laugh and mock all they want, those fucking parasites, you're about to be proved right. Sentient AI
  is a possibility! Werr-Heyn was a know nothing hack! But what happened after that... 
  BSci, MSci, MEng, PhD, ScD, Emeritus Professor at the Scientific Institute. You are a decorated academic, so decorated in
  fact you're on what is known as the "can't die" list. A list of over 10,000 noteworthy individuals, whose death would be
  such a loss for humanity that you have to be periodically backed up. Except being a 300 year old in a 20 something's body
  does prove to be mentally taxing.
  
  Some of your colleagues think you're insane, others think you're a murderer. Werr-Heyn, your colleague from 2 centuries
  earlier, proved conclusively that sentient AI was impossible. Well conclusively for everyone but you. The fallout that 
  followed would lead to an academic rivalry so fierce some suspected (and still do) that it ended in foul play. Suffice it 
  to say the can't die list was one name shorter after Werr-Heyn's death and loss of all his backups.
  Still to this day, you maintain your conviction to the fact that Werr-Heyn was wrong, and that sentient AI can exist, and
  may very well already exist.
