cyphers:
  - name: Warping Nanovirus
    description: >
      No mad scientist would be fit without a couple of doomsday devices lying around, and at least one on their person
      at all times. The warping nanovirus came to you in a dream, and you forgot it in another dream, but alas you still
      have a vial of the prototype, loaded into an autotargetting serum injector. It deals 6 damage, plus 2 damage for 3 
      rounds as it convulses its victims organs. Victim must be in immediate range.
  - name: Charged finger
    description: >
      The worst part about tasers is their ease to spot, so why not replace your finger for one and then amp it up to 50,000
      Volts and use it on unsuspecting victims. Your right index finger is a prosthetic taser, with a single charge use
      that when used on an unsuspecting target immediately incapacitates them. Cannot be used during combat
equipment:
  - name: Technology scanner
    description: >
      How can you steal other people's ideas without understanding them first? The technology scanner eases the perception
      of any tech related items.
  - name: Translator
    description: >
      A small device you built whilst arguing with a colleague at the Scientific Institute, the translator learns any language
      and translates to and from it. Unfortunately it has a tendency to back fire and express a rude sentiment. Generally
      eases social interaction tasks across languages. May result in a GM Intrusion.
  - name: Datajacker
    description: >
      You have a small port concealed by your jawline, mistakeable for a piercing, into which you can interface with most 
      computer and security terminals. You are removed from reality for the duration of a datajack, and so cannot perceive
      things going on around you. Typical data jacks take 5 mins. Eases any technology task
weapons: none
description: >
  Whispers and stares in the hallway as Internal Security Agency officials carry boxes out of you office at the Scientific
  Institute. They can laugh and mock all they want, those fucking parasites, you're about to be proved right. Sentient AI
  is a possibility! Werr-Heyn was a know nothing hack! But what happened after that... 
  
  BSci, MSci, MEng, PhD, ScD, Emeritus Professor at the Scientific Institute. You are a decorated academic, so decorated in
  fact you're on what is known as the "can't die" list. A list of over 10,000 noteworthy individuals, whose death would be
  such a loss for humanity that you have to be periodically backed up. Except being a 300 year old in a 20 something's body
  does prove to be mentally taxing.
  
  Some of your colleagues think you're insane, others think you're a murderer. Werr-Heyn, your colleague from 2 centuries
  earlier, proved conclusively that sentient AI was impossible. Well conclusively for everyone but you. The fallout that 
  followed would lead to an academic rivalry so fierce some suspected (and still do) that it ended in foul play. Suffice it 
  to say the can't die list was one name shorter after Werr-Heyn's death and loss of all his backups.
  
  Still to this day, you maintain your conviction to the fact that Werr-Heyn was wrong, and that sentient AI can exist, and
  may very well already exist.
