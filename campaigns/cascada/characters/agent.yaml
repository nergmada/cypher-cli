    mind reading by two steps
- name: Light-slice Crystal**
  description: >
    Adepts can manipulate light-slice crystals to make themselves temporarily invisible (but still 
    corporeal). Works by slicing the light and bending it round its wearer. Once used, the crystal

- name: Adept Lightning Capacitors
  description: >
    Single use gauntlets, with pre-charged capacitors capable of delivering a targeted electrical 
    shock across a short range with a damage of 6. Due to the ability of adepts to visualise 
    targets, this weapon can cast around corners, and through any material that will not disrupt 
    the path of an electrical current (i.e. water)
equipment:
- name: Psychic Lock Pick
  description: >
    Lock picking tools typically have handles and various other things, that are necessary for 
    users that don't have the ability to manipulate small physical objects with their mind. Your 
    lock picking tools have had the handles removed and special metals laced into them to make 
    picking locks with your mind easier. Eases lock-picking tasks by one level. 
- name: Telekinetic Bolas
  description: > 
    balls on a rope are a primitive way to trip up and disturb the balance of targets, but 
    effective when you can target them accurately with your mind. Eases escaping tasks and chase 
    tasks.
weapons:
- name: An ISA Telekinetic Pistol
  description: > 
    A pistol with bullets laced for Telekinetic control, allowing the operator to fire round 
    obstacles if effort is applied
description: >
  A man in a hologram hurriedly warns you about an impending attack, as your computer screen flickers with a host of files
  you're receiving, suddenly the man turns. Banging can be heard on the audio, and then a hail of gun shots as the man leaves
  the frame of the hologram and the transmission cuts out. You feel an intense and overwhelming sadness, as you cry. You slam
  the desk with your fists, before recomposing yourself. But he means nothing to you now, who is he? Why were you so sad?
  and what was he warning you about?
  
  As a young Telepath from a privileged background, you joined the Internal Security Agency, ISA, of The Quorum of Twelve, when
  you were 19. Telepaths are generally feared throughout the habited worlds, and occurences of telepathic abilities have
  dropped significantly due to the stigmatisation surrounding them. Yet telepathic abilities are a great asset for people in
  certain roles.
  
  Trained to use your telepathic abilities in the field, you are a well respected agent, even in spite of the well known
  clumsiness and chaos that follows you wherever you go.
