  description: >

    pulsating pebble like device sits on the forehead of a restrained suspect and vibrates. Eases 
    mind reading by two steps
- name: Light-slice Crystal**
  description: >
    Adepts can manipulate light-slice crystals to make themselves temporarily invisible (but still 
    corporeal). Works by slicing the light and bending it round its wearer. Once used, the crystal 
    is damaged and cannot be reused. Effective for 30 seconds. 
- name: Adept Lightning Capacitors
  description: >
    Single use gauntlets, with pre-charged capacitors capable of delivering a targeted electrical 
    shock across a short range with a damage of 6. Due to the ability of adepts to visualise 
    targets, this weapon can cast around corners, and through any material that will not disrupt 
    the path of an electrical current (i.e. water)
equipment:
- name: Psychic Lock Pick
  description: >
    Lock picking tools typically have handles and various other things, that are necessary for 
    users that don't have the ability to manipulate small physical objects with their mind. Your 
    lock picking tools have had the handles removed and special metals laced into them to make 
    picking locks with your mind easier. Eases lock-picking tasks by one level. 
- name: Telekinetic Bolas
  description: > 
    balls on a rope are a primitive way to trip up and disturb the balance of targets, but 
    effective when you can target them accurately with your mind. Eases escaping tasks and chase 
    tasks.
weapons:
- name: An ISA Telekinetic Pistol
  description: > 
    A pistol with bullets laced for Telekinetic control, allowing the operator to fire round 
    obstacles if effort is applied
description: >
  A man in a hologram hurriedly warns you about an impending attack, as your computer screen flickers with a host of files
  you're receiving, suddenly the man turns. Banging can be heard on the audio, and then a hail of gun shots as the man leaves
  the frame of the hologram and the transmission cuts out. You feel an intense and overwhelming sadness, as you cry. You slam
  the desk with your fists, before recomposing yourself. But he means nothing to you now, who is he? Why were you so sad?
  and what was he warning you about?
  
  As a young Telepath from a privileged background, you joined the Internal Security Agency, ISA, of The Quorum of Twelve, when
  you were 19. Telepaths are generally feared throughout the habited worlds, and occurences of telepathic abilities have
  dropped significantly due to the stigmatisation surrounding them. Yet telepathic abilities are a great asset for people in
  certain roles.
  
  Trained to use your telepathic abilities in the field, you are a well respected agent, even in spite of the well known
  clumsiness and chaos that follows you wherever you go.
updates:
  - name: If music be the food of love
    info: >
      Sat in a music hall on Zerra Prima, you remember looking across at the man in the hologram and feeling the overwhelming 
      feeling of butterflies. He gets up to take a call as you continue to watch the opera play out, until you realise 
      he's not coming back. Disappearing into the lobby he is nowhere to be seen, gone.
  - name: Erasure
    info: >
      As the Orrin ships rained down fire upon the Citrine Eagle and The Hitman and The Captain tried in vain to fend of their attacks 
      you felt an overwhelming power summoned deep within you. Anger, fear, and a protective instinct result in an overwhelming psychic blast 
      as your whole party loses consciousness destroying your attackers in the process
  - name: ISA help
    info: >
      You remember an ISA contact is based on Medeira, to "liaise" with the locals for information when it suits the Quorum 
      they are in The Eclipse Tavern in the red light district. Connor has a tendency to abuse the sauce hence the crap 
      assignment. Connor trained you at the academy though, and didn't drum you out after a rifle range mishap.
  - name: In the name of love
    info: >
      As Karan Dan's projection appears in the throne room before you and your companions, you remember his face. The man you'd 
      grown to love over 5 years, who disappeared in a blink of an eye, only to re-emerge a year later, a prisoner Orrin Corp. 
      You mounted a rescue mission to Canbar-Dan to liberate him, but, you got more than you bargained for
  - name: My heart, My mind, My soul
    info: >
      Emblazoned on the floor of the shrine, a large carved symbol that you instantly recognise. One that corresponds to a 
      that carved into the gemstone on a necklace that Karan-Dan gave you before he disappeared. You look down to see the 
      crystal glow within the necklace
