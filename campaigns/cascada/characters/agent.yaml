description: >
  A man in a hologram hurriedly warns you about an impending attack, as your computer screen flickers with a host of files
  you're receiving, suddenly the man turns. Banging can be heard on the audio, and then a hail of gun shots as the man leaves
  the frame of the hologram and the transmission cuts out. You feel an intense and overwhelming sadness, as you cry. You slam
  the desk with your fists, before recomposing yourself. But he means nothing to you now, who is he? Why were you so sad?
  and what was he warning you about?
  As a young Telepath from a privileged background, you joined the Internal Security Agency, ISA, of The Quorum of Twelve, when
  you were 19. Telepaths are generally feared throughout the habited worlds, and occurences of telepathic abilities have
  dropped significantly due to the stigmatisation surrounding them. Yet telepathic abilities are a great asset for people in
  certain roles.
  Trained to use your telepathic abilities in the field, you are a well respected agent, even in spite of the well known
  clumsiness and chaos that follows you wherever you go.
