      circuitry. Does 6 damage to any target with technology components (prosthetic limbs, implants etc)
  - name: Emergency Laser Cutter
    description: >
      Imagine a laser pen, now imagine it connected to an unnecessarily large power source. The emergency laser cutter is

      precision cutting tasks by 2 levels

  - name: Zeus' Harpoon (Medium)
    description: >
      A harpoon like device, about the size of a heavy pistol, which does damage to electronic devices as if it were a heavy

description: >
  A street smart scavenger who grew up on Canbar-Dan during the Orrin restoration, you saw your near decimated planet rebuilt 
  to such opulent wealth, that you went from the poverty of war to the poverty of a planet unaffordable to anyone but the 
  incredibly wealthy.
  
  As a tech hunter, you cracked robots, machines, and technology, to sell on the black market, to Orrin competitors or sometimes 
  those so poor that they have no choice but to seek the technology they need to live from a black market so prepared to take 
  an entire person's life saving for a replacement digi-kidney.

  One day, whilst cracking an Orrin base's security systems for a mysterious employer who seemed very interested in some very boring 
  aspects of Orrin's security you hear gun shots from a nearby archive room. As you draw your harpoon and approach, 
  the rest becomes a blur.
updates:
  - name: Archival Mercy
    info: >
      Approaching the archive, your harpoon drawn you spot an Orrin goon stood over another scavenger, The Professor. You shoot him
      with the harpoon knocking him to the ground and helping The Professor up, as you flee the room The Professor fires a shot, 
      trapping The Hitman under a data stack
  - name: Emergency Broadcast
    info: >
      As you attempt to get a power cable from the engine to the main lounge, the professor wires up a radio telescope for transmission
      the professor is clearly intelligent, but has no regard for quality craftmanship. Still, as The Citrine Eagle comes under fire, you 
      help send this broadcast. But who you're transmitting to is still not clear.
  - name: My Employer's an AI
    info: > 
      The hologram of Karan-Dan flashes off and you realise that your employment to infiltrate the archive was to assist in 
      the liberation of an AI. Sent to disable security protocols that seemed of little value of interest, the job makes sense.
