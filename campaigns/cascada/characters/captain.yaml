description: >
  The last thing you remember was being approached by a Quorum Attache, on a moon around Rigell 8. They
  place a folder down in front of you and as you open it, a Quorum Credit Chip and an Internal Security Agency
  badge fall out, they give you a knowing nod. You smirk back. What did they ask you to do? What happened? 
  And what kind of trouble are you in this time?

  You used to be a marine pilot in the Quorum military services, jumping from hover vehicles, to piloting battle 
  cruisers takes a special kind of mentality, and you were one of the best. But natural ability met its match
  with a reckless disregard for authority, and you ended up leaving the military and going private. 
  
  Acting as a military contractor to the Quorum for any odd job they can't have their own troops conduct.
