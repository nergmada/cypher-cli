description: >
  Karan-Dan is 6'1, of a dark latin complexion, with brown eyes and a close cut. His 
  accent is somewhat warped from that of other hispanic spacefarers, owing to the fact that 
  it is largely derivative of the workforce he encountered or Canbar-Dan during his time
  with Orrin Corp. His face has a noticeable scarring along the right side. He appears in a 
  formal dinner look, wearing a suit and waistcoat, but lacking a jacket. Blue, with a red tie.
