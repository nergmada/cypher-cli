description: >
  The beetle like robot scurries about the digsite, with two laser cutter antennae which it uses 
  to carefully carve out small chunks of rock unveiling the complex labyrinthean city that lies 
  beneath the surface. Occasionally, the old robots get stuck and one of the militia have to give 
  them a kick to free them.
