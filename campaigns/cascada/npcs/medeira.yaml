description: >
  Medeira is a tall demure woman in her 30s. She has long white hair with two evidently dyed red streaks swept back 
  from the fringe trailing down her back. Her brown eyes are obscured by sunglasses which she peers over. Wearing tough
  combat trousers, and a t shirt, as well as a short cut jacket. She is not evidently armed, but seems very confident 
  staring down your heavily armed party. A single small portable device, probably some kind of communicator, is on her hip 
  flashing, until with a single click she disables it. As she steps forward, you notice a visible tattoo, of some kind of
  lizard or salamander curve down from her left jawline and disappear into the collar of her shirt and jacket
