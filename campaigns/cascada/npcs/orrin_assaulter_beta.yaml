  The Armoured Assault trooper is clearly much more dangerous than the local militia, 
  wearing visible yellow Orrin Armour, with Orrin logos on the chest, and a red glow being emitted
  from each eye hole of the troops mask. Their rifle, a laser sighted long rifle designed to hit
  targets even at long distances is another piece of nasty Orrin military ware.
