> "I am a Strong-Willed Fighter who Fuses Mind and Machine"

(Please send me your choices/decisions for all "(**Task**)" items mentioned)

## Name
(**Task**) Pick a name for your character

## Background
A street smart scavenger who grew up on Canbar-Dan during the Orrin restoration, you saw your near decimated planet rebuilt 
to such opulent wealth, that you went from the poverty of war to the poverty of a planet unaffordable to anyone but the 
incredibly wealthy.

As a tech hunter, you cracked robots, machines, and technology, to sell on the black market, to Orrin competitors or sometimes 
those so poor that they have no choice but to seek the technology they need to live from a black market so prepared to take 
an entire person's life saving for a replacement digi-kidney.

One day, whilst cracking an Orrin base you hear gun shots from a nearby archive room. As you draw your harpoon and approach, 
the rest becomes a blur.

## Warrior Profile
You’re a good ally to have in a fight. You know
how to use weapons and defend yourself.
Depending on the genre and setting in question,
this might mean wielding a sword and shield in
the gladiatorial arena, an AK-47 and a bandolier
of grenades in a savage firefight, or a blaster
rifle and powered armor when exploring an alien
planet.

- **The Frymaster**: A small frying pan, fitted with a small EMP charge, the non-stick coating on the base as well as the shape of the pan allow for easy sliding and maximum conductance of charge for frying a variety of robotic and mechanical circuitry. Does 6 damage to any target with technology components (prosthetic limbs, implants etc)
