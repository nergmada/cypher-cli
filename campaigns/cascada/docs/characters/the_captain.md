(Please send me your choices/decisions for all "(**Task**)" items mentioned)

## Name
(**Task**) Pick a name for your character

## Background
The last thing you remember was being approached by a Quorum Attache, on a moon around Rigell 8. They
place a folder down in front of you and as you open it, a Quorum Credit Chip and an Internal Security Agency
badge fall out, they give you a knowing nod. You smirk back. What did they ask you to do? What happened? 
And what kind of trouble are you in this time?

You used to be a marine pilot in the Quorum military services, jumping from hover vehicles, to piloting fighters, to helming battle cruisers takes a special kind of mentality, and you were one of the best. 

But natural ability met its match with a reckless disregard for authority, and you ended up leaving the military and going private. 

Acting as a military contractor to the Quorum for any odd job they can't have their own personnel conduct. 

## Explorer Profile
You are a person of action and physical ability,
fearlessly facing the unknown. You travel to
strange, exotic, and dangerous places, and
discover new things. This means you’re physical
but also probably knowledgeable.

### Stats
you start with stat pools as follows:

- might: 10
- speed: 9
- intellect: 9

(**Task**)
You can allocate six additional points, to any stat pool you like, or allocate to any mix of stat pool.

### Edge
Your edge is
- might: 1
- speed: 0
- intellect: 0

### Effort
Your effort is level 1

### Cyphers
You can carry 2 cyphers at any one time

- Stimjack Tablets: Stimjack Tablets were designed by Quorum R&D to wire pilots during long combat operations. Due to a limited supply of the ingredients necessary to make Stimjack, they're rare. You roll 1d6 and restore that many points to any stat pool when consumed. Action

(**Additional**) If you have an additional cypher you would like your character to start with, I welcome suggestions

### Equipment

#### Clothing/Armor
(**Task**) Pick appropriate clothing for your character, typically your clothing will offer at most +1 Armor protection. 

#### Equipment
- **Interstellar Astrolabe**: An interstellar astrolabe can use the stars visible in the night sky to determine the current planet as well as where you are located on the planet. Only works at night.
- **Planetary Map**: A device that contains a selection of maps for many worlds. Not universal, but most habitable and inhabited worlds will be available if they have a space port. Requires a location to work. Eases navigation tasks.
- **Pilot's Guild Token**: The Independent Federation of Pilots, known as The Pilot's Guild, or even just The Guild, is an association of pilots, with representation throughout the galaxy. Presentation of a pilot guild's token to the right individual can gain you access to some otherwise off limits locations, or a tip of information in your time of need. Eases select social interactions.

#### Weapon
- **Telescopic Engineering Knife (Light)**: A telescopic knife that expands in length to almost a katana. general melee weapon, also serves as an omni-toolfor simple repair tasks, such as cutting free wires, opening panels etc. you know, for when you're not trying to scare the natives
- **Dual Akimbo Defence Pistol + flashlight (Medium)**: The Dual Defence Pistol was a pistol designed to allow pilots to defend against armored targets in the case of a crash. Firing two rounds at a single point using an auto-targetting intersection system. Anyone crazy enough to wield two of these firearms at the same time is not to be messed with

## Chaotic Descriptor
Danger doesn’t mean much to you, mainly because you don’t think much about repercussions. In fact, you enjoy sowing surprises, just to see what will happen. The more unexpected the result, the happier you are. Sometimes you are particularly manic, and for the sake of your companions, you restrain yourself from taking actions that you know will lead to disaster.
You gain the following characteristics:
- **Tumultuous**: +4 to your Speed Pool.
- **Skill**: You are trained in Intellect defense actions.
- **Chaotic**: Once after each ten-hour recovery roll, if you don’t like the first result, you can reroll a die roll of your choice. If you do, and regardless of the outcome, the GM presents you with a GM intrusion.
- **Inability**: Your body is a bit worn from occasional excesses. Might defense tasks are hindered.

(**Task**) Please note that your stat pool has not be adjusted to take into account the descriptor modifications, so you will need to calculate your final stat pool including these mods
