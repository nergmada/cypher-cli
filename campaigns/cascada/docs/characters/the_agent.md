(Please send me your choices/decisions for all "(**Task**)" items mentioned)

## Name
(**Task**) Pick a name for your character

## Background
A man in a hologram hurriedly warns you about an impending attack, as your computer screen flickers with a host of files you're receiving, suddenly the man turns. Banging can be heard on the audio, and then a hail of gun shots as the man leaves the frame of the hologram and the transmission cuts out. You feel an intense and overwhelming sadness, as you cry. You slam the desk with your fists, before recomposing yourself. But he means nothing to you now, who is he? Why were you so sad? and what was he warning you about?
  
As a young Telepath from a privileged background, you joined the Internal Security Agency, ISA, of The Quorum of Twelve, when you were 19. Telepaths are generally feared throughout the habited worlds, and occurences of telepathic abilities have dropped significantly due to the stigmatisation surrounding them. 

Yet telepathic abilities are a great asset for people in certain roles. Trained to use your telepathic abilities in the field, you are a well respected agent, even in spite of the well known clumsiness and chaos that follows you wherever you go.

## Adept Profile
Telekinetic Abilities and Telepathic abilities have recently been starting to exhibit in 29th century humans. As human reach expanded beyond the solar system, they began to develop the ability to manipulate matter, and even intepret thoughts in other creatures, although to claim they can read minds is a stretch for most Adepts.

### Stats
You start with stat pools as follows:

- might: 7
- speed: 9
- intellect: 12

(**Task**)

### Effort
Your effort is level 1

### Cyphers
You can carry 3 cyphers at any one time

You currently possess a single cypher

- **Sonic Mindfucker**: An ISA device, designed to reduce the resistance of suspects to psychic interrogation. This pulsating pebble like device sits on the forehead of a restrained suspect and vibrates. Eases mind reading by two steps
- **Light-slice Crystal**: Adepts can manipulate light-slice crystals to make themselves temporarily invisible (but still corporeal). Works by slicing the light and bending it round its wearer. Once used, the crystal is damaged and cannot be reused. Effective for 30 seconds. 
- **Adept Lightning Capacitors**: Single use gauntlets, with pre-charged capacitors capable of delivering a targeted electrical shock across a short range with a damage of 6. Due to the ability of adepts to visualise targets, this weapon can cast around corners, and through any material that will not disrupt the path of an electrical current (i.e. water)

### Equipment

#### Clothing/Armor
(**Task**) Pick appropriate clothing for your character, typically your clothing will offer at most +1 Armor protection.

#### Equipment
- Psychic Lock Pick: Lock picking tools typically have handles and various other things, that are necessary for users that don't have the ability to manipulate small physical objects with their mind. Your lock picking tools have had the handles removed and special metals laced into them to make picking locks with your mind easier. Eases lock-picking tasks by one level. 
- Telekinetic Bolas: balls on a rope are a primitive way to trip up and disturb the balance of targets, but effective when you can target them accurately with your mind. Eases escaping tasks and chase tasks.

(**Additional**) Your equipment allows for one moderately priced items, and four inexpensive items. These have not been allocated, but if there is additional equipment you feel you would like, please suggest

#### Weapon
You can use light weapons without penalty. You have an inability Medium and Heavy weapons, this makes you hindered.

- **An ISA Telekinetic Pistol**: A pistol with bullets laced for Telekinetic control, allowing the operator to fire round obstacles if effort is applied

### Abilities

(**Task**)
Choose four of the abilities listed below

#### Distortion

**Type**: Action to initiate

**Cost**: 2 Intellect points

You modify how a willing creature within short range reflects light for one minute. The target rapidly shifts between its normal appearance and a blot of darkness. The target has an asset on Speed defense rolls until the effect wears off

#### Erase Memories

**Type**: Action

**Cost**: 3 Intellect points

You reach into the mind of a creature within immediate range and make an Intellect roll. On a success, you erase up to the last five minutes of its memory

#### Far Step

**Type**: Action

**Cost**: 2 Intellect points

You leap through the air and land some distance away. You can jump up, down, or across to anywhere you choose within long range if you have a clear and unobstructed path to that location. You land safely

#### Hedge Magic

**Type**: Action

**Cost**: 1 Intellect point

You can perform small tricks - temporarily change the color or basic appearance of a small object, cause small objects to float through the air, clean a small area, mend a broken object, prepare (but not create) food, and so on. You can't use Hedge Magic to harm another creature or object

#### Magic Training

**Type**: Enabler

**Cost**: none

You are trained in the basics of magic (including the operation of magic artifacts and cyphers) and can attempt to understand and identify its properties

#### Onslaught

**Type**: Action

**Cost**: 1 Intellect point

You attack a foe using energies that assail either their physical form or their mind. In either case, you must be able to see your target. If the attack is physical, you emit a short-range ray of force that inflicts 4 points of damage. If the attack is mental, you focus your mental energy to blast the thought processes of another creature within short range. This mindslice inflicts 2 points of Intellect damage (ignores Armor). Some creatures without minds (such as robots) might be immune to your mindslice

#### Push

**Type**: Action

**Cost**: 2 Intellect points

You telekinetically push a creature or object an immediate distance in any direction you wish. You must be able to see the target, which must be your size or smaller, must not be affixed to anything, and must be within short range. The push is quick, and the force is too crude to be manipulated. For example, you can't use this ability to pull a lever or close a door

#### Resonance Field

**Type**: Action to initiate

**Cost**: 1 Intellect point

Faint lines in a color you choose form a tracery over your entire body and emit faint light. The effect lasts for one minute. Whenever a creature within immediate range makes an attack against you, the pattern energizes to block the attack. You can make an Intellect defense roll in place of the defense roll you would normally make. If you do so and you get a minor effect, the creature attacking you takes 1 point of damage. If you get a major effect, the creature attacking you takes 4 points of damage

#### Scan

**Type**: Action

**Cost**: 2 Intellect points

You scan an area equal in size to a 10-foot (3 m) cube, including all objects or creatures within that area. The area must be within short range. Scanning a creature or object always reveals its level. You also learn whatever facts the GM feels are pertinent about the matter and energy in that area. For example, you might learn that the wooden box contains a device of metal and plastic. You might learn that the glass cylinder is full of poisonous gas, and that its metal stand has an electrical field running through it that connects to a metal mesh in the floor. You might learn that the creature standing before you is a mammal with a small brain. However, this ability doesn't tell you what the information means. Thus, in the first example, you don't know what the metal and plastic device does. In the second, you don't know if stepping on the floor causes the cylinder to release the gas. In the third, you might suspect that the creature is not very intelligent, but scans, like looks, can be deceiving. Many materials and energy fields prevent or resist scanning

#### Shatter

**Type**: Action

**Cost**: 2+ Intellect points

You interrupt the fundamental force holding normal matter together for a moment, causing the detonation of an object you choose within long range. The object must be a small, mundane item composed of homogeneous matter (such as a clay cup, an iron ingot, a stone, and so on). The object explodes in an immediate radius, dealing 1 point of damage to all creatures and objects in the area. If you apply Effort to increase the damage, you deal 2 additional points of damage per level of Effort (instead of 3 points); targets in the area take 1 point of damage even if you fail the attack roll

#### Telepathic

**Type**: Action to establish contact

**Cost**: 1+ Intellect points

You can speak telepathically with others who are within short range. Communication is two-way, but the other party must be willing and able to communicate. You don't have to see the target, but you must know that it's within range. You can have more than one active contact at once, but you must establish contact with each target individually. Each contact lasts up to ten minutes. If you apply a level of Effort to increase the duration rather than ease the task, the contact lasts for 24 hours

#### Ward

**Type**: Enabler

**Cost**: none

You have a shield of energy around you at all times that helps deflect attacks. You gain +1 to Armor

## Clumsy Descriptor

Graceless and awkward, you were told that youâ€™d
grow out of it, but you never did. You often drop
things, trip over your own feet, or knock things
(or people) over. Some people get frustrated by
this quality, but most find it funny and even a
little charming.

You gain the following characteristics:
- **Butterfingers**: âˆ’2 to your Speed Pool.
- **Thick-Muscled**: +2 to your Might Pool.
- **Inelegant**: You have a certain lovable charm.
You are trained in all pleasant social interactions
when you express a lighthearted, self-deprecating
manner.
- **Dumb Luck**: The GM can introduce a GM
intrusion on you, based on your clumsiness,
without awarding you any XP (as if you had rolled
a 1 on a d20 roll). However, if this happens,
50% of the time, your clumsiness works to your
advantage. Rather than hurting you (much), it
helps you, or it hurts your enemies. You slip, but
itâ€™s just in time to duck an attack. You fall down,
but you trip your enemies as you crash into their
legs. You turn around too quickly, but you end up
knocking the weapon from your foeâ€™s hand. You
and the GM should work together to determine
the details. If the GM wishes, they can use GM
intrusions based on your clumsiness normally
(awarding XP).
- **Skill**: Youâ€™ve got a certain bull-like quality. You
are trained in tasks involving breaking things.
- **Inability**: Any task that involves balance, grace,
or hand-to-eye coordination is hindered.

(**Task**) Please note that your stat pool has not be adjusted to take into account the descriptor modifications, so you will need to calculate your final stat pool including these mods
