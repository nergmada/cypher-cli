> "I am a Mad Speaker who Conducts Weird Science"

(Please send me your choices/decisions for all "(**Task**)" items mentioned)

## Name
(**Task**) Pick a name for your character

## Background
Whispers and stares in the hallway as Internal Security Agency officials carry boxes out of you office at the Scientific Institute. They can laugh and mock all they want, those fucking parasites, you're about to be proved right. Sentient AI is a possibility! 

Werr-Heyn was a know nothing hack! But what happened after that... 

BSci, MSci, MEng, PhD, ScD, Emeritus Professor at the Scientific Institute. You are a decorated academic, so decorated in fact you're on what is known as the "can't die" list. A list of over 10,000 noteworthy individuals, whose death would be such a loss for humanity that you have to be periodically backed up. Except being a 300 year old in a 20 something's body does prove to be mentally taxing.
  
Some of your colleagues think you're insane, others think you're a murderer. Werr-Heyn, your colleague from 2 centuries earlier, proved conclusively that sentient AI was impossible. Well conclusively for everyone but you. The fallout that followed would lead to an academic rivalry so fierce some suspected (and still do) that it ended in foul play. 

Suffice it to say the can't die list was one name shorter after Werr-Heyn's death and loss of all his backups. Still to this day, you maintain your conviction to the fact that Werr-Heyn was wrong, and that sentient AI can exist, and may very well already exist.

## Speaker Profile
You’re good with words and good with people. You talk your way past challenges and out of jams, and you get people to do what you want.

### Stats
you start with stat pools as follows:

- might: 8
- speed: 9
- intellect: 11

(**Task**)
You can allocate six additional points, to any stat pool you like, or allocate to any mix of stat pool.

### Edge
Your edge is
- might: 0
- speed: 0
- intellect: 1

### Effort
Your effort is level 1

### Cyphers
You can carry 2 cyphers at any one time

- **Warping Nanovirus**: No mad scientist would be fit without a couple of doomsday devices lying around, and at least one on their person at all times. The warping nanovirus came to you in a dream, and you forgot it in another dream, but alas you still have a vial of the prototype, loaded into an autotargetting serum injector. It deals 6 damage, plus 2 damage for 3 rounds as it convulses its victims organs. Victim must be in immediate range.
- **Charged finger**: The worst part about tasers is their ease to spot, so why not replace your finger for one and then amp it up to 50,000 Volts and use it on unsuspecting victims. Your right index finger is a prosthetic taser, with a single charge use that when used on an unsuspecting target immediately incapacitates them. Cannot be used during combat

### Equipment

#### Clothing/Armor
(**Task**) Pick appropriate clothing for your character, typically your clothing will offer at most +1 Armor protection. 

#### Equipment
- **Technology scanner**: How can you steal other people's ideas without understanding them first? The technology scanner eases the perception of any tech related items.
- **Translator**: A small device you built whilst arguing with a colleague at the Scientific Institute, the translator learns any language and translates to and from it. Unfortunately it has a tendency to back fire and express a rude sentiment. Generally eases social interaction tasks across languages. May result in a GM Intrusion.
- **Datajacker**: You have a small port concealed by your jawline, mistakeable for a piercing, into which you can interface with most computer and security terminals. You are removed from reality for the duration of a datajack, and so cannot perceive things going on around you. Typical data jacks take 5 mins. Eases any technology task

#### Weapons

None

### Abilities

#### Anecdote

**Type**: Action to initiate, one minute to complete

**Cost**: 2 Intellect points

You can lift the spirits of a group of creatures and help them bond together by entertaining them with an uplifting or pointed anecdote. For the next hour, those who pay attention to your story are trained in a task you choose that's related to the anecdote, as long as it's not an attack or defense task

#### Babel

**Type**: Enabler

**Cost**: none

After hearing a language spoken for a few minutes, you can speak it and make yourself understood. If you continue to use the language to interact with native speakers, your skills improve rapidly, to the point where you might be mistaken for a native speaker after just a few hours of speaking the new language

#### Datajack

**Type**: Action

**Cost**: 1 Intellect point

With computer access, you jack in instantly and learn a bit more about something you can see. You get an asset on a task involving that person or object

#### Demeanor of Command

**Type**: Action to initiate

**Cost**: 2 Intellect points

You project confidence, knowledge, and charisma to all who see you for the next hour. Your demeanor is such that those who see you automatically understand that you are someone important, accomplished, and with authority. When you speak, strangers who are not already attacking give you at least a round to have your say. If speaking to a group that can understand you, you can attempt to have them produce their leader or ask that they take you to their leader. You gain a free level of Effort that can be applied to one persuasion task you attempt during this period

#### Encouragement

**Type**: Action

**Cost**: 1 Intellect point

While you maintain this ability through ongoing inspiring oration, your allies within short range ease one of the following task types (your choice) - defense tasks, attack tasks, or tasks related to any skill that you are trained or specialized in

#### Enthrall

**Type**: Action

**Cost**: 1 Intellect point

While talking, you grab and keep another creature's attention, even if the creature can't understand you. For as long as you do nothing but speak (you can't even move), the other creature takes no actions other than to defend itself, even over multiple rounds. If the creature is attacked, the effect ends

#### Erase Memories

**Type**: Action

**Cost**: 3 Intellect points

You reach into the mind of a creature within immediate range and make an Intellect roll. On a success, you erase up to the last five minutes of its memory

#### Fast Talk

**Type**: Action

**Cost**: 1 Intellect point

When speaking with an intelligent creature who can understand you and isn't hostile, you convince that creature to take one reasonable action in the next round. A reasonable action must be agreed upon by the GM; it should not put the creature or its allies in obvious danger or be wildly out of character

#### Hacker

**Type**: Action

**Cost**: 2 Intellect points

You gain quick access to a desired bit of information in a computer or similar device, or you access one of its primary functions

#### Inspire Aggression

**Type**: Action to initiate

**Cost**: 2 Intellect points

Your words twist the mind of a character within short range who is able to understand you, unlocking their more primitive instincts. As a result, they gain an asset on their Might-based attack rolls for one minute

#### Interaction Skills

**Type**: Enabler

**Cost**: none

You are trained in two skills in which you are not already trained. Choose two of the following - deceiving, persuading, public speaking, seeing through deception, or intimidation. You can select this ability multiple times. Each time you select it, you must choose two different skills

#### Knowledge Skills

**Type**: Enabler

**Cost**: none

You are trained in two skills in which you are not already trained. Choose two areas of knowledge such as history, geography, archeology, and so on. You can select this ability multiple times. Each time you select it, you must choose two different skills

#### Lab Analysis

**Type**: Action to initiate, 2d20 minutes to complete

**Cost**: 3 Intellect points

You analyze the scene of a crime, the site of a mysterious incident, or a series of unexplained phenomena, and maybe learn a surprising amount of information about the perpetrators, the participants, or the force(s) responsible. To do so, you must collect samples from the scene. Samples are paint or wood scrapings, dirt, photographs of the area, hair, an entire corpse, and so on. With samples in hand, you can discover up to three pertinent pieces of information about the scene, possibly clearing up a lesser mystery and pointing the way to solving a greater one. The GM will decide what you learn and what level of difficulty is needed to learn it. (For comparison, discovering that a victim was killed not by a fall, as seems immediately obvious, but rather by electrocution, is a difficulty 3 task for you.) The task is eased if you take the time to transport the samples to a permanent lab (if you have access to one), as opposed to conducting the analysis with your field science kit

(For comparison, discovering that a victim was killed not by a fall, as seems immediately obvious, but rather by electrocution, is a difficulty 3 task for you.) The task is eased if you take the time to transport the samples to a permanent lab (if you have access to one), as opposed to conducting the analysis with your field science kit

#### Machine Interface

**Type**: Enabler

**Cost**: 2 Intellect points

For one minute you gain an asset on tasks to discern the level, function, and activation of technological devices that you touch

#### Practiced With Medium Weapons

**Type**: Enabler

**Cost**: none

You can use light and medium weapons without penalty. If you wield a heavy weapon, attacks with it are hindered

#### Scramble Machine

**Type**: Action

**Cost**: 2 Intellect points

You render one machine within short range unable to function for one round. Alternatively, you can hinder any action by the machine (or by someone attempting to use the machine) for one minute

#### Spin Identity

**Type**: Action

**Cost**: 2+ Intellect points

You convince all intelligent creatures who can see, hear, and understand you that you are someone or something other than who you actually are. You don't impersonate a specific individual known to the victim. Instead, you convince the victim that you are someone they do not know belonging to a certain category of people. “We're from the government.” “I'm just a simple farmer from the next town over.” “Your commander sent me.” A disguise isn't necessary, but a good disguise will almost certainly be an asset to the roll involved. If you attempt to convince more than one creature, the Intellect cost increases by 1 point per additional victim. Fooled creatures remain so for up to an hour, unless your actions or other circumstances reveal your true identity earlier

#### Tech Skills

**Type**: Enabler

**Cost**: none

You are trained in two skills in which you are not already trained. Choose two of the following - crafting, computers, identifying, machines, piloting, repairing, or vehicle driving. You can select this ability multiple times. Each time you select it, you must choose two different skills

#### Terrifying Presence

**Type**: Action

**Cost**: 2+ Intellect points

You convince one intelligent target of level 3 or lower that you are its worst nightmare. The target must be within short range and be able to understand you. For as long as you do nothing but speak (you can't even move), the target is paralyzed with fear, runs away, or takes some other action appropriate to the circumstances. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the maximum level of the target. Thus, to terrorize a level 5j target (two levels above the normal limit), you must apply two levels of Effort

#### Tinker

**Type**: Action to initiate

**Cost**: 1 Intellect point

You make a device do something different from its original purpose. For example, a blaster becomes a bomb. A scanner becomes a signal booster for a radio transmitter. A music player becomes a battery for another device. The effective level of the modified device is 1 lower than normal, and the device is rendered unusable (for its original purpose) until repaired

#### Understanding

**Type**: Action

**Cost**: 1 Intellect point

You observe or study a creature or object. Your next interaction with that creature or object gains one asset

## Mad Descriptor

You have delved too deeply into subjects people were not meant to know. You are knowledgeable in things beyond the scope of most, but this knowledge has come at a terrible price. You are likely in questionable physical shape and occasionally shake with nervous tics. You
sometimes mutter to yourself without realizing it.

You gain the following characteristics:
- **Knowledgeable**: +4 to your Intellect Pool.
- **Fits of Insight**: Whenever such knowledge is appropriate, the GM feeds you information although there is no clear explanation as to how you could know such a thing. This is up to the GM’s discretion, but it should happen as often as once each session.
- **Erratic Behavior**: You are prone to acting erratically or irrationally. When you are in the presence of a major discovery or subjected to great stress (such as a serious physical threat), the GM can introduce a GM intrusion that directs your next action without awarding XP. You can still pay 1 XP to refuse the intrusion. The GM’s influence is the manifestation of your madness and thus is always something you would not likely do otherwise, but it is not directly, obviously harmful to you unless there are extenuating circumstances. (For example, if a foe suddenly leaps out of the darkness, you might spend the first round babbling incoherently or screaming the name of your first true love.)
- **Skill**: You are trained in one area of knowledge (probably something weird or esoteric).
- **Inability**: Your mind is quite fragile. Tasks to resist mental attacks are hindered.

(**Task**) Please note that your stat pool has not be adjusted to take into account the descriptor modifications, so you will need to calculate your final stat pool including these mods
