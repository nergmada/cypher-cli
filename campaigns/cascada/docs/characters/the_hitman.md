## Name
(**Task**) Pick a name for your character

## Background
The smoke of a burning Uspid Pot fills the hotel room, the local narcotic delicacy is not to your taste, but your half naked companion likes it and so that's good enough. The receiver on the table side buzzes once, and you answer. Instructions to intercept an ISA security team and recover a data payload from them, The rest is a blur, but now you're on their ship, and neither you nor they are dead, so circumstances have clearly changed. What happened in the 24 hours since then, is less clear.

You are an Orrin Corporation clone. The Orrin Corporation uses clones to genetically enhance them for specific tasks that unenhanced humans can't do. It is illegal to clone on most worlds, but clones are protected under Quorum charter, so once created, it is illegal to destroy them just for existing.

You were one of three, cloned for the purpose of private corporate espionage, assassination and if necessary special operations in private corporate wars. 

## Warrior Profile
You’re a good ally to have in a fight. You know
how to use weapons and defend yourself.
Depending on the genre and setting in question,
this might mean wielding a sword and shield in
the gladiatorial arena, an AK-47 and a bandolier
of grenades in a savage firefight, or a blaster
rifle and powered armor when exploring an alien
planet.

- **Boro-Hanz Durrow Annihilator (Heavy)**: On Uddan 4, Durrows are a raccoon like pest that grows to be about 3 metres long, the Durrow Annihilator was developed specifically for this purpose, but has become a favourite of Assassins due to the fact it vaporises bodies. On larger targets, it has no immediate effect, but may cause sterility after prolonged exposure
- **The Arc-Caster (Medium)**: A popular choice of weapon for blind hunters, the Arc-Caster is a close range scatter weapon, designed to cover a maximal radius. Unfortunately it has a significant splash zone, due to the highly piercing nature of the shrapnel it projects

## Honorable Descriptor
You are trustworthy, fair, and forthright. You try to do what is right, to help others, and to treat them well. Lying and cheating are no way to get ahead—these things are for the weak, the lazy, or the despicable. You probably spend a lot of time thinking about your personal honor, how best to maintain it, and how to defend it if challenged. In combat, you are straightforward and offer quarter to any foe.

You were likely instilled with this sense of honor by a parent or a mentor. Sometimes the distinction between what is and isn’t honorable varies with different schools of thought, but in broad strokes, honorable people can agree on most aspects of what honor means.

You gain the following characteristics:
- **Stalwart**: +2 to your Might Pool.
- **Skill**: You are trained in pleasant social interactions.
- **Skill**: You are trained in discerning people’s true motives or seeing through lies.

(**Task**) Please note that your stat pool has not be adjusted to take into account the descriptor modifications, so you will need to calculate your final stat pool including these mods
