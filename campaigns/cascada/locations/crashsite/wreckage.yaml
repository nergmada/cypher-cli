  As you step off the ship and out of the anti-gravity effects of the only recently fixed gravity shield,
  you feel your weight heavier than on most other worlds. The ship is visibly on fire in many places, and the 
  auto disembark procedure for the vehicle starts a soon as the ship's VI detects that you're clear of the 
  disembarkation area. 
  A cavern sits beneath a cliff perch that overlooks the desert, and a faint glow of irridescent fauna radiates 
  from the mouth of it, striking even in the bright daytime sun. Past the cave, a passage out into the desert [UPCPT]
