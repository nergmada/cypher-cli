  The mouth of the cavern glows faintly in the bright desert sun, as the plants dangling from the inner ceiling
  glow a faint glow. The mouth leads into a much larger subterranean cave network, The network appears to stretch
  beneath the sands of the deserts for miles, and probably offers shelter to some of the more solar-sensitive 
  creatures on this planet
