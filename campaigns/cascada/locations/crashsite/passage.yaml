description: >
  The desert passage leads through a canyon, through a running stream, the speeder barely fits, but 
  thanks to its all-terrain capabilities has little trouble negotiating the area. As you venture through 
  you see beacons and markers thrown into the ground and mounted on the sheer face of the canyon's walls

  On the walls you see etching and drawings from a long lost civilisation, the cryptic nature of the language
  is indecipherable to any of your team.
