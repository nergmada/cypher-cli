  The cliff top looks over the vast expanse of the planets seemingly infinite desert, the rock formations are 
  striking and almost certainly heavenly to look at during the evening. This cliff offers a good position to 
  transmit and survey the area. To the rear, a snaking canyon leading back to the crash site and then 
  further to the desert below
