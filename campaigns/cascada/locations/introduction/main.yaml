  The year is 2321 human's have spread amongst the galaxy, reaching far beyond their own
  solar system to conquer the heavens and the stars. Though many thousands of planets have
  been touched by human exploration, corporate expansion and wealthy autocratic wannabes no
  sentient life on a par with that we call sapien has been found. 
  
  Whilst many planets host a wide array of fauna and creatures, none have life or civilisation
  on the scale brought to it by the arrival of people. But a few planets do have the remanants of
  civilisation, tombs, temples and entire towns, worn down by the forces of nature to be nothing more
  than a loosely organised pile of rubble and artifacts.
  
  Preserved, only by the fact that famine, plague or war obliterated the inhabitants before they had a
  chance to scavenge the remains. Of course, with them humanity also brought politics, greed, lust
  and the other vices and sins once only contained to planet Earth. Great mega corporations rule vast
  regions of space and hold wealth on a scale larger than all of human history combined. 
  
  Orrin Corp, one of many super-conglomorates is one of the largest. The Orrin Corporation is a giant 
  interstellar conglomerate of several thousand different corporate entities, manufacturing everything 
  from medicines, weaponry, starships and software. The Orrin Corporation operates on almost every human touched 
  world in the galaxy. Even in places where people do not know of words such as freedom or liberty, 
  they know the name Orrin. 
  
  Despite the vast expanse of space, the human race, unsatisfied with the quantity of resources, continually wages wars 
  to control various systems perceived to be of strategic or economic value. In 2278 this led to one of the largest
  mass genocides in human history, when the luxury agricultural planet, Canbar-Dan was bombed from orbit with fusion
  warheads, wiping out the inhabitants (except those off-world at the time). 
  
  In the resulting peace treaties, the Quorum of Twelve, formed of representatives of large corporate interests, various 
  democratic and autocratic worlds, and individuals of unimagineable wealth established itself as a peace keeping body.
  Slowly over time, the Quorum grew to enfranchise more of the habited worlds, liberating some, and enslaving others. 
  Canbar-Dan was rebuilt by the Quorum, largely with the resources of The Orrin Corporation and became their new central 
  base of operations

  Floating adrift in space, The Citrine Eagle and its passengers awake, confused and delirious, struggling to remember 
  the events of the past 3 days. The ship's onboard Virtual Intelligence is repeating, through the silence of the drift,
