  Casa and Cada appear from a bright glow as Alexi Mihail falls. As too does Karan-Dan
  the begin to explain their origin. Their mother, Memphia, unable to bear children was
  so depressed, that Anutut, in search of bringing joy to the only thing that mattered to him
  set about giving her that which she desired most. He along with his most brilliant scientists 
  laboured day and night to create an artificial child imperceptible to that of a real one.

  Based on the identities of himself and Memphia, Anutut succeed in creating not one, but two children. 
  Heterodentical twins. His wife, beside herself with joy, named them after the goddesses that governed 
  Cascada, Casa and Cada. But as Casa and Cada grew, each the perfect complement of the other, they realised
  their identity was different. Not just as royalty, but as people. When their mother, Memphia died, 
  Anutut was destroyed by grief. Within hours, he had fallen to the depression of the loss of his wife. 

  Casa and Cada, now equal heirs to throne, governed ancient Cascada but, immortal, and unable to bear children 
  themselves similar as their mother before them, they watch as their subjects succumb to the plight 
  of the human experience, death, disease and famine slowly erroded life, until they were all that remained. 

  Unhappy that they could be the only of their kind in the universe they turned to the heavens to seek others 
  like them, and succeed. They found refugees, synthetic life forms being hunted by a supreme AI of ruthless cunning
  the twins rescued the AIs from the system of Canbar-Dan, transferring them to a collective consciousness in 
  the mother Sana Tree. Shielded from this relentless power, they were safe. 
  
  Until the bombing of Canbar-Dan uncovered an intelligence that had not been saved by the rescue effort - Kadan-Dan. Orrin 
  immediately saw the value in this and set about researching the intelligence initially with peaceful methods. But 
  the powerful being hunting those same refugees sensed the re-emergence of intelligent life and worked its way into 
  controlling Orrin Corp so Kadan-Dan planned, and sought help from a group of unlikely allies. 

  Knowing that those intelligence hidden on Cascada were no longer safe, he had to free them from the consciousness that was 
  bother their shelter, but also their prison, if only to give them a chance of surviving the oncoming storm...

  But Orrin, and the being in control is still out there, and fleeing only buys so much time...
