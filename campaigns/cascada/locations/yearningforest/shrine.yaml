  The shrine is an unusual juxtaposition to its exterior. The tree has been carved out to give a much more square feel
  to this inner shelter. Still the roots of the trees visibly grow around the room and break the otherwise perfect edges.
  The other contrast is the bodies of Orrin troops of the floor, scorched with electrical and plasma burns unlike anything 
  else. 
  At the centre of the room sits two women, legs folded, in monk robes. Behind them, a previous complete shrine gives way 
  to a hidden door, it which has been affixed a glowing red crystal
