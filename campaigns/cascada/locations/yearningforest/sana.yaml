  Sana Township is scattered amongst a thousand branches of the mother Sana Tree. As you speed towards the base of the goliath
  fauna, you notice a small guard of Orrin troops, awaiting the arrival of interlopers. A sana resident lies tied up at 
  the base. Clearly Orrin has no intention of interference.

  A climb lies ahead for our explorers to reach the town as the rope lifts are cut by alerted troops
  
  All Sana Tree roots on Cascada connect to this single mother tree, they are like a nerve centre for the entire planet.
