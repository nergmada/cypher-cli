description: >
  Sana Town centre has been conquered by an imposing force of Orrin troops, residents cower in their houses as 
  corpses scatter over the town. Surrounding the central trunk of the vast network, the vicious looking combatants 
  are imposing are look merciless. Beyond them lies an ancient shrine, carved into the tree centuries ago and renovated 
  by the new religious order.
