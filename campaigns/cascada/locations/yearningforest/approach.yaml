  The desert collides with the yearning forest in a shocking way. A near barren waste land almost instantly fills with 
  vegatation on a scale of unbelieveable magnitude. In the distance, what was once a searing heat, has been dropped to 
  a wintery chill. Visible snow storms lie ahead in The Yearning Forest. The meteological climate of Cascada, providing 
  an unusual clash of distinct biomes.
  Overhead, Alexi Mihail's ship disappears into the distance as you give chase
