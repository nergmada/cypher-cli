description: >
  The Fountain sits above the tree canopy, in the atmosphere shrouded in a cloud that makes it near invisible from
  space. Crashed into the surface, Alexi Mihail's ship, brought down by an apparent forcefield around the fountain 
  scattered around the decay and bones of other ships that have fallen prey to the fountain's same shield, trapped 
  and beyond rescue, they succumb to the wilderness of the upper atmosphere. 
  Alexi Mihail stands between you and the fountain.
