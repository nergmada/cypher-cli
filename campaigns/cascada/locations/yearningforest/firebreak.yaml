  The firebreak stretches the length of the the forest, nearly 2000 miles. The earth has been salted by the previous 
  occupants of Cascada in such a way that nothing will grow along this strip of land for a thousand years. It was only 
  when humans first landed on Cascada that they decided a road would be a suitable addition to this stretch of land.
  The mountain range in the distance hosts the most northern town of Cascada, Sana township.
