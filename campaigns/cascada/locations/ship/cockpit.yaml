  The Citrine Eagle's Cockpit is a cluttered mess, containing a raised chair in the left
  of the large porthole that overlooks the direction of travel, behind on the left and right
  wall are two consoles with chairs situated next to them, one of the panels is non-functional
  the other badly damaged with a touch screen that flickers. Small sparks of electricity fall
  from the ceiling from a blown power coupler.
