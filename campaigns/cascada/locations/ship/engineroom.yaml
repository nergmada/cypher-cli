  The Citrine Eagle's Engine room hosts a large reactor for deep space travel, a slow 
  cargo ship engine, it's not designed to support the manouvres it has clearly had to perform
  as a result fluid is leaking out of it into a floor drain, a visible glow of light is 
  radiating from the fluid and the ship's VI is warning that there is dangerous levels of 
  radiation in the room
