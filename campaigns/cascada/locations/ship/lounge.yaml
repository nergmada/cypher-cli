  The Citrine Eagle's lounge is a utilitarian affair, with a small ornate wooden table
  dominating the centre of an otherwise metal plating clad room. Scattered around the 
  room is various clutter, that - due to the lack of gravity - is free floating and
  severely reducing visibility, the larger furnishings being affixed to the floor
  have no such issues
