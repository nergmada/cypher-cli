  The Citrine Eagle's lounge is a utilitarian affair, with a small ornate wooden table
  painted white dominating the centre of an otherwise metal plating clad room. Scattered around the 
  room is various clutter, that - due to the lack of gravity - is free floating and
  severely reducing visibility, the larger furnishings being affixed to the floor
  have no such issues. A bay door opens to provide a ramp, for the onloading and offloading
  of passengers and cargo. Namely, a large 5 seater speeder vehicle. A small fire is ongoing in one of 
  the power conduits. Adjoined to the cockpit and living quarters of the ship
