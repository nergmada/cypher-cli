  Given Medeira's reputation throughout the rest of this neighbourhood of interstellar space, it's almost laughable 
  the idea it should have a red light district. The red light district of Medeira though caters to similar tastes to 
  other red light districts throughout the galaxy, predominantly, sex, alcohol, drugs and entertainment and any combination 
  of those therein.
