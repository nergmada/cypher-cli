description: >
  Acklay Communications is a small market stall staffed by a single robot. The table has a list of transmission 
  distances and prices, confusingly printed and stuck to it. Acklay Communications have a reputation for listening 
  to broadcasts they're not supposed to, whether they're by their own clients or the clients of other off-world transmission
  companies
