description: >
  Big Marconi's is a relatively compact mixture of storage facilities, hanger bays and a single large launch pad for some 
  kind of recovery ship. As you enter into the first floor hanger, you see a dwarf of a man, standing at meagre 4ft 9inches 
  he looks up at you. "Welcome to Big Marconi's" he says as he wipes the crap and grease off himself from reaching into 
  the various parts of the ships
