  The Governor's Sanctum is without a doubt the most beautiful of the districts in Medeira, almost entirely owned 
  by Medeira and her various consorts and cronies, it is a fusion of technological towers, at the heart of it an 
  ancient palace, restore to much of its original form. But the outer gates of the district are guarded by a heavy 
  division of personal bodyguards. Entry is strictly forbidden except to those with an invitation.
