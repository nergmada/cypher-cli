description: >
  The city gate of Medeira is a grand stone archway, clearly an old structure built before the arrival of colonists
  but retrofitted with more modern comforts, the gateway is a ray shield, rather than the primitive wood blockade which 
  once acted as the defence of the city. 
  Outside, a city guard stands on duty watches as you enter the grand city' gate way
  A grand avenue leads through the centre of the town up to a grand marble and gold statue, clearly not an original work, 
  instead a tacky copy, an odious testament to the current ruler of Medeira
