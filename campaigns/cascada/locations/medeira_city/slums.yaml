  The medeira slums are a rough tightly packed space, full of peasants, scavangers, scrappers and various 
  other criminal entities looking for a living. In the centre, a small ray of hope, a Scientific Institute Field Lab

  poorly maintained tech and a selection of other delicious illegal hardware that on Quorum world's would carry the 
  death penalty
