  The field lab is littered with cots, with peasants and beggars from the streets of Medeira occupying many of 
  them. The lab has equipment for both medicinal and testing purposes scattered around the edge of the tent. A sole doctor 
  monitors each patient and takes samples, with the assistance of a mute local helper.
