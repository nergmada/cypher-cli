  The palace is somewhat out of place in the rest of Medeira, almost every inch of the city has been corrupted by it's 
  reinhabitation by the human race. Yet Medeira's Palace is perfectly preserved, and by comparison, small and unwhelming.
  Ornate silks decorate its many towers, each with a visible military presence. If Medeira's garishness has yet to corrupt this 
  palace's architecture, it certainly has corrupted the ambiance.
