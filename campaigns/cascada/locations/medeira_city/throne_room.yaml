  The throne room is striking and captivating, the tilted scales at the back speak volumes about the kind of woman
  who rules here. The room itself, however, has no visible military presence. Not a single guard to corrupt the otherwise
  regal feel of this space. Stood to the left, in a somewhat less than regal style, Medeira, the indisputable Queen of 
  Medeira City.
