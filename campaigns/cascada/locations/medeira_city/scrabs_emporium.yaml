  The Tech Scavenger's Emporium is full of as much self evident garbage as it is valuable items. Skolar and Sholar 
  to brothers stand behind the counter of the store and look at you, their new clientele. "I am Sholar", "I am Skolar", "We
  are the finest technological emporium on cascada" they say in unison with a sleeze that even a second hand ship dealer 
  could not conjure.
