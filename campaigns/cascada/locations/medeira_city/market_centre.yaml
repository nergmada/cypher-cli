  The Medeira Trader's District has so many market stalls it's almost impossible to comprehend what couldn't be 
  purchased here. The heavier guard presence makes it clear that everyone here is a full and paid up member of 
  Medeira's protection racket. Whilst stores sell all sorts of items for the weary traveller, only a few are 
  reputable enough to take Quorum Qubes.
  Big Marconi's Shipwrights & Vehicle Repair sits at the centre of the market centre, with a landing pad mounted 
  on the roof. Acklay' Transmissions sat next to it, shares an antenna coming off the main pad structure.
