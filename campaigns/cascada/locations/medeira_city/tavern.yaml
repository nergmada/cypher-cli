  The Eclipse Tavern is one of the less popular and more depressing establishments of Medeira, and hosts a largely local 
  crowd, including one drunken ISA agent, sat at the bar. The taverns some what desolate plant life offer a little 
  comfort that at least something can live in this squalor. [Connor dead, it's a trap]
