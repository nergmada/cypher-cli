description: >
  The base camp is a large tent erected in the desert, with a smaller barn adjacent for storing animals, vehicles
  and supplies for the teams working here. Inside the main tent a bank of equipment mounts up on collapsible tables
  a small field lab. A couple of robotic arms descend from the ceiling and mechanically work at two of the tables scanning
  artifacts and then carefully subjecting them to a barrage of tests
  A couple of Cascadan lab hands assist in the moving of larger artifacts. Outside, a local militiaman stands watch with 
  a cheap and potentially ineffective rifle.
