  The canyon opens to a more inhabited region, the outside of a large archaeological dig site, striking
  red fabric bridges the walls of the canyon making the ceilings lower than the apparent rock faces. 
  As you approach the digsite, you notice a defense turret concealed in one of the many clay pots that 
  lie at the exterior of the entrance to the main site.
