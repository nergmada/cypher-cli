description: >
  The library is grand a scattered with shattered glass, broken wood, and crumbling texts. Most
  are illegible, years of decay and neglect and have seen their contents lost to the ether. But, deeper in
  the library, a few lights still flicker, behind a translucent door. A thousand year bulbs with still a few 
  years left to run. The bookshelves are high and the rooms of meandering and mostly caved in. Lots of places 
  for creatures to hide
