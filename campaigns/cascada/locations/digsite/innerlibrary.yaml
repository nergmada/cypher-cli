description: >
  The inner room is as ancient as the rest of the library, but better used. Scribbled on paper, everywhere,
  like the ravings of a madman. Two symbols, a tree, and what looks like a fountain. The same symbols have been
  carved into the floor, roughly, with a sharp implement, maybe a knife. Atop the second floor balcony there is
  a telescope, with a receiver attached. Ancient and broken, but pointing upwards through the window to a sky that
  is no longer visible due to the rocks.
