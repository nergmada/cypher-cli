  The Memphia Opera House is a small opera house by comparison to even those built in the ancient earth era, 
  seating no more than a couple of hundred people. The performances would have been intimate, when this 
  house was in use. Now the most striking note being struck is the imposing beauty who stands in the rear of the 
  house, looking towards the stage. The statue of Memphia, stands eternal watching the performers. 
  The statue is visibly decayed and clear lines are starting to show in the carving of it.
