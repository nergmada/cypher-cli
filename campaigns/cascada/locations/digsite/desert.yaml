  The desert is vast, spreading in every direction as you hit the gas towards Medeira City, 
  you see a tank with the Orrin logo emblazoned on its hull, as it crosses the horizon and begins firing 
  shots, you flee in the direction of Medeira when out of the earth emerges a vast worm like creature 
  with a thousand teeth, pursuing both your pursuer and you.
  Chase Rules - Player rules for each level of pursuer, they're trying to escape, uneased. And then applies
  ease to the target number calculation
