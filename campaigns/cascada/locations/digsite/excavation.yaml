  The digsite excavation is a confusing contrast between the hulking metal reinforcing frames that surround the canyon walls
  and the stone artifacts and structures that lie within the mouth of the canyon. The Ancient Cascadian structures 
  have crumbled over time but are brutal clash of technological interfaces and impressive stone architecture.
  Two drilling robots are scurrying around over walls and drilling. A militiaman occasionally interferes with the 
  bug like robots, helping them get unstuck by giving them a shove or a kick.
  The stone structures of the ancient city are built into the walls, and as the robots drill it is clear that there is still
  a lot of the city contained in the desert stone that has formed around the lost city
